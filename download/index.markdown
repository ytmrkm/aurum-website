## Download aurumOS

All **live images** are available at:

- [{{ site.download_mirror }}]({{ site.download_mirror }})


An internet connection via Ethernet or WiFi is required for network installation.

### Verifying file integrity and its digital signature

It is strongly recommended to validate the integrity and authenticity of any
downloaded image or tarball before using it, to ensure it hasnâ€™t been tampered
with. [Instructions on how to do
that](https://docs.voidlinux.org/installation/index.html#verifying-images)
are provided in the [Void Handbook](https://docs.voidlinux.org/).

It will be necessary to download the [checksum file]({{ site.download_mirror }}/sha256sum.txt)
and its [signature]({{ site.download_mirror }}/sha256sum.sig) for this step.
